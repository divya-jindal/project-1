## Overview

Physical activity is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health and well-being with numerous benefits including physical, mental, and emotional health. However, amidst the modern lifestyle characterized by sedentary behavior and technological advancements, rates of physical inactivity have surged, posing significant public health challenges. The consequences of inadequate physical activity manifest in various forms, including an increased risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Because of this, understanding the relationship between physical inactivity and disease rates is imperative for informing targeted interventions and policies aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing the burden of preventable diseases.

This project seeks to delve into the complex interplay between physical activity levels and disease prevalence across the United States. By analyzing nationwide data on physical inactivity rates alongside disease rates we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and disparities that shed light on the health implications of sedentary behavior. In our data analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights into the epidemiological landscape of physical inactivity and its impact on public health outcomes.

Factors influencing physical activity levels and disease prevalence are diverse and interconnected encompassing: individual behaviors, income disparity, food availability, cultural norms, access to healthcare, and systemic inequalities. This project uses selected data regarding a few possible factors to analyze trends and make conclusions about how these factors can influence the general healthiness of the U.S. population.

## Heart Disease Rates Per State

The first part of this project looks at each state individually and combines the total city data per state to conclude the heart disease rates of each state. The top 10 highest heart disease rates are located and noted. 

## Obesity and Inactivity

The obesity and inactivity rates are found for 500 cities. The summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, max, etc) are found for both the obesity and inactivity data. The data is then isolated by the state, city, and county level. The obesity and inactivity rates for each state is plotted to determine the lowest and highest rates. For each of the three levels, the correlation between obesity and inactivity due to no leisure time is found to determine whether there is some level of relation between the two. 

## Obesity and Inactivity vs. Heart Disease

The data about obesity, inactivity, and the heart disease rates per state is then combined. The correlation between obesity vs. heart disease and the correlation between inactivity vs. heart disease across all 50 states is found.  


## Per Capita Income vs. Heart Disease

The per capita income at the city, state, and county level is found using the Census data. The per capita income for the state and county level is plotted against the heart disease rates to determine if there is any correlation between income and heart disease rates. 

## Mental Health vs. Heart Disease

 The data regarding the percentage of adults with poor mental health for more than two weeks is found at the state level. The summary statistics for each state's percentages is found. The mental health percentage for each state is plotted to determine the states with the lowest and highest mental health percentage. The states with a descending rate of heart disease is also found to find commonalities between the two.
