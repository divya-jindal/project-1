## Overview

Physical activity is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health and well-being with numerous benefits including physical, mental, and emotional health. However, amidst the modern lifestyle characterized by sedentary behavior and technological advancements, rates of physical inactivity have surged, posing significant public health challenges. The consequences of inadequate physical activity manifest in various forms, including an increased risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Because of this, understanding the relationship between physical inactivity and disease rates is imperative for informing targeted interventions and policies aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing the burden of preventable diseases.

This project seeks to delve into the complex interplay between physical activity levels and disease prevalence across the United States. By analyzing nationwide data on physical inactivity rates alongside disease rates we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and disparities that shed light on the health implications of sedentary behavior. In our data analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights into the epidemiological landscape of physical inactivity and its impact on public health outcomes.

Factors influencing physical activity levels and disease prevalence are diverse and interconnected encompassing: individual behaviors, income disparity, food availability, cultural norms, access to healthcare, and systemic inequalities. This project uses selected data regarding a few possible factors to analyze trends and make conclusions about how these factors can influence the general healthiness of the U.S. population.

## Heart Disease Rates Per State

The first part of this project looks at each state individually and combines the total city data per state to conclude the heart disease rates of each state. The top ten states with highest heart disease rates are: West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Alabama, Florida, Lousiana, Indiana, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania. The states with the lowest heart disease rates are: Alaska, Utah, Hawaii, Colorado, and Vermont.  

## Obesity and Inactivity

The obesity and inactivity rates are found for 500 cities. The summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, max, etc) are found for both the obesity and inactivity data. The data is then isolated by the state, city, and county level. The obesity and inactivity rates for each state is plotted to determine the lowest and highest rates. For each of the three levels, the correlation between obesity and inactivity due to no leisure time is found to determine whether there is some level of relation between the two. The data shows the presence of a strong correlation between obesity and inactivity due to no leisure time at the state, city, and county levels. From this, it can be concluded that involuntary inactivity is strongly related with obesity across the board.  

## Obesity and Inactivity vs. Heart Disease

The data about obesity, inactivity, and the heart disease rates per state is then combined. The correlation between obesity vs. heart disease and the correlation between inactivity vs. heart disease across all 50 states is found. The correlation coefficient for both obesity and inactivity against heart disease 0.72. This demonstrates a strong correlation between heart disease rates and obesity as well as a strong correlation between heart disease rates and inactivity due to no leisure time.   


## Per Capita Income vs. Heart Disease

The per capita income at the city, state, and county level is found using the Census data. The per capita income for the state and county level is plotted against the heart disease rates to determine if there is any correlation between income and heart disease rates. There seems to be no correlation between income and heart disease rates regardless of whether the data is looked at from the state or county level.   

## Mental Health vs. Heart Disease

 The data regarding the percentage of adults with poor mental health for more than two weeks is found at the state level. The summary statistics for each state's percentages is found. The mental health percentage for each state is plotted to determine the states with the lowest and highest mental health percentage. The states with a descending rate of heart disease is also found to find commonalities between the two. The five states with the highest mental health percentages are: Delaware, Ohio, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Michigan. The five states with the lowest mental health percentages are: Hawaii, South Dakota, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Alaska. A scatterplot is also plotted between the heart disease rates and the mental health percentages and is found to have a strong, positive correlation.

## Limitations

The biggest limitation is the fact that only 500 cities are used to draw conclusions about each state and the country as a whole. Analyzing only a few cities per state to draw generalizations about the entire state seems a bit naive. It is difficult to confidentally say that any of the conclusions drawn at the state level are close to the truth. Also, the data only contained information about the largest cities in the United States, which contain metropolitan areas that generally have higher incomes. Essentially, the range of income data for the 500 cities will be skewed to the larger side and may not represent the true income disparity throughout the United States. With regards to the mental health data, the data values are very subjective. People have different interpretations about what they mean by a poor mental health state, which can influence the data value significantly.
